#Assignment No 1:

Q1. What is your understanding of Block-chain?

a)Block-chain is a continuous growing ledger keeping a permanent record in a secure,chronological and immutable way in decentralized distributed network.
b)Block-chain is a a mixture of two technologies i.e Distributed Database and Cryptography where information is:
Verifiable
Tamper-proof
Unchangeable
Immutable


Q2. What is the core problem block-chain trying to solve?

Block-chain is trying to solve the core problems like:
Authenticity
Security
Need of powerful third party to trust


Q3. What are the few features which block-chain will give u?

Block-chain will give us the features like:
Verifiable
Tamper-proof
Unchangeable
Immutable


Q4. What all things does a Block Contain?

A Block Number
A Block contains data(current information/transaction)
Fingerprint
Mining key

Q5. How is the verifiability of Block-chain is been attained ?

Verifiability of block chain is achieved by the following way as below:

Block 1
0 + new data = Fingerprint 1

Block 2
Fingerprint 1 + new data = Fingerprint 2

and this chain continues.

Simply we can say with the help of Fingerprint we can validates the data among all the blocks.
